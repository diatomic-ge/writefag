>You are Anonymous, resident alien of Ponyville.
>"Anon."
>When you arrived here in an incident involving a toaster and 32 pounds of nitrogen triiodide and woke up in a world of colorful horses, you immediately decided to fuck with them.
>"Hey, Anon."
>Most locals consider you eccentric or insane, but harmless.
>"Hello?"
>You've recently decided to pretend not to notice anything of certain colors based on the day of the week.
>"Anon!"
>Today is Wednesday, and Wednesday is green and blue.
>You've been pretending everything of either of these colors doesn't exist since you left your house this morning.
>So far, you've ignored that one cocky blue pony, and have walked into the side of a sky blue house.
>Every witness merely shrugged these off.
>"Anon?"
>A certain aquamarine unicorn doesn't seem to have gotten it yet, though.
>Lyra has been following you for the last twelve minutes.
>You know this exactly because you spend an hour training on the weekends so you can stare at random objects before remarking the time.
>"Answer me, Anon!"
>It's fun to watch the ponies try to figure out where the clock you're looking at is.
>"Come on, Anon!"
>You're sure she'll pick it up eventually.
>You finally arrive at Applejack's apple stand.
"Good morrow, GREAT APPLE LORD! I have journeyed to your stand from afar that I might procure seven less than fifteen red spheres!"
>"Err, howdy there, Anon. That'll be six bits."
>You fumble about in your pockets for a small amount of the local currency.
>You check your left pocket, your right pocket, your left pocket again, and look behind you before pulling six bits from your right pocket.
>"Applejack, can you knock some sense into Anon? He's been ignoring me all morning."
>"Now, Anon, it ain't nice to ignore yer friends like that."
"...Who am I ignoring, again?"
>"Me."
>After a brief pause, Applejack sighs.
>"Yer ignoring Lyra."
"...I haven't seen her all day."
>"Anon! That's no way to-"
>"It's alright, AJ. It's probably just Anon being Anon. I'll catch him tomorrow."
>Lyra trots off to who knows where.
>Finally. You don't know how much longer you could suppress your giggling.
>You hand Applejack your bits.
"Here are your half dozen disks to add to the hoard."

>You take your apples to the nearby park for lunch.
>You eat here whenever you can.
>The park is always relaxing, warm with a cool breeze across its grassy field, gently causing ripples along an otherwise still pond.
>Best of all, unlike similar parks back home, the ground wasn't caked in goose shit.
>Today, the park was cool.
>The sky above was covered in dark grey stratocumulus clouds, obscuring the sun and preventing shadows.
>The weather, preparation for a nice storm tonight, cast a dull light on the scenery.
>The muted colors reminded you of home, whereas everything in Equestria seemed painted by a child with blindingly pure hues.
>As you are dozing off, you hear a shuffling off to the side.
>You peek out between your eyelids to see a box moving under a nearby tree.
>It is probably some kid playing in a box.
>Most of the kids here find you hilarious, so you decide to surprise whoever it is.
>You quietly sneak over to the box, before quickly pulling it off its owner.
"Gotcha!"
>You can scarcely make out a brown blur flying out from under the box and darting behind the tree.
"I did not mean to scare you, citizen. Would you care to take part in activities of amusement?"
>You hear what sounds like "eep" and pause for a response.
>Some of the more skittish children need some time to get used to a giant talking ape.
>"P-please give me back my box, sir."
>You look at the box briefly, before acquiescing and setting the box at the base of the tree.
"I have returned the prism!"
>As you back away to allow your new friend some space, you begin to consider the peculiarities of this situation.
>You may be relatively new here, but that voice sounded more like a mare than a child.
>The muddy box also seems quite worn, ripped at the folds and missing a corner.
>The side of the box has a few words scribbled on it: "5 bits: Hoofjob, 10 bits: Fulltime, 20 bits: Anything"
>Despite that you have no idea what "fulltime" means in this context, and the ambiguity of "anything", you certainly understand "hoofjob".
>A twinge of sadness breaks through your normally ecstatic visage as a brown mare shakily walks from behind the tree toward her box.
>Except for a few issues with the ponies' black-and-white morality, everything seemed like an idyllic paradise in pony world.
>In a world where the worst emergencies seem like the plot of a children's cartoon, you would have never given thought to such pitiful situations.
>You watch with a frown as the mare, covered in mud and a few bruises, unsteadily drags her box away from you.
>You know what you need to do.
"Hey!"
>"Y-yes?"
"What is your name?"
>"M-morning Glory."
"What exactly does 'anything' entail?"
>"A-anything."
"This is filled with wonderment! I require such services."
>You pull out 48 bits from your pocket and place them in the box.
"Please follow me, we ought make haste!"
>She seems hesitant to follow a complete stranger away from her only possession.
>You need to get her to come with you.
"I know why you hesitate. It is no large swordfish."
>You grab an apple from your bag and hand it to her.
>"Th-thank you."
>She looks at you with watery eyes as she accepts the apple, before you pick up her box and start walking.
>"Sh-shir! 'ey! Gibe me my bok!"
>She hurries after you, trying to speak around the apple in her mouth, as you begin to jog.
"Yes! This enthusiasm for your task is admirable. We must venture onwards!"
>"Shtop!"

>You are Morning Glory
>You were minding your own business in the park, trying to find somewhere to take shelter before it started raining, when a bipedal... thing came out of nowhere and took your... home.
>It blabbered some nonsense and... hired you.
>You were so grateful for the apple the psychotic giant offered that you nearly missed it running off with your home.
>A few years back, you'd have shrugged it off.
>Now, that box is all you have in this world.
>You have been running after him for a few minutes.
>Panting, you stumble over your own hoof and land face first in a puddle.
>Most ponies would have been easily able to run that distance, but after a year of little shelter and only whatever scraps of food you could dig out of the trash you are exhausted after a short jog.
>You've at least gotten better at seeing the silver linings to events.
>Somepony litters and leaves a box in an alley? There's your shelter for the future.
>Some kids laugh while throwing rotten food at you? That's more food than you've eaten most weeks.
>You fall over in a puddle? You're probably cleaner now.
>You try to stand to resume your chase, before your trembling legs give out.
>You end up with your muzzle stuck in the water of a puddle? Maybe you'll drown.
>As you give up running after the bizarre creature and sink into the puddle you close your eyes.
>You suddenly feel something wrap around your barrel as your body lurches upwards.
>"Now is no time for rest, compatriot! The war is not over until we fatten their women and make them sing in glorious symphony for us!"
>You really don't care enough at this point to respond.
>Let him do whatever he wants with you.
>You found out long ago that it never ends well when you struggle, and this creature seems to have his own brand of crazy.
>You drift off into a haze as you rhythmically sway gently, ignoring the raving of your captor.

>You snap back into awareness with a jolt as you feel yourself falling, and flail to land on your hooves, before you notice that he merely set you down on a wooden floor.
>He seems to be looking at you with a serious gaze.
>You've learned to be cautious when crazies act serious ever since that stallion came after you with a knife.
>"Now I need to ask you a very important question."
>As he leans in closer, you try to scoot away.
>"Your answer to this question will determine much of your future."
>He stares into your soul as you begin to hyperventilate.
>"The exact words you say will decide how you come out of this."
>He places his hands on your shoulder as tears stream from your eyes.
>This is it. This psycho's going to kill you. You just hope it'll be quick.
>"How do you like your eggs?"
>You have no idea how to answer this.
>You hesitate.
>"Well?"
"S-scrambled?"
>You whimper out your response, hoping that you've found the answer he was looking for.
>After a moment he smiles, as you notice the sharp, flesh-rending canines in his mouth.
>"Come with me, you should get cleaned up before dinner."
>As you try to keep a straight face, he leads you to the first bath you've seen in nearly a year.
>"Feel free to take as long as you need. Descend the stairs of wonder when you are ready to eat."
>As soon as he closes the bathroom door, you press your ear against it, listening for his footsteps leading him from you.
>You fill the bathtub as you think about your situation.
>You know that those are the teeth of a carnivore.
>That psycho's probably fattening you up to kill and eat you.
>You step into the bathtub as the mud soaks out of your coat.
>You may as well go out with some dignity.
>Maybe if you ask nicely, he'll do it quickly. That'd be nice.
>You lie down in the tub as you quietly cry.

>You are Anon.
>You are currently making scrambled eggs for Morning Glory.
>She was a little scared at first. That's normal. You're the only human here, and she's been living on the streets for who knows how long.
>You tried to diffuse it with your humor, but you're not sure if she found it entertaining.
>She was a bit confused when you offered her food, though.
>She must not be used to strangers showing her kindness.
>By the time you showed her the bath, a weary smile and tears of joy were upon her face at the prospect of a bath after quite some time.
>It warms your heart to bring happiness to another.

>You hum as you set your table for yourself and your guest, bending over to place two large plates of scrambled eggs and the variety of fruit you found throughout your kitchen.
>You're still not used to the table.
>Being taller than most inhabitants of this world, you had custom-made furniture.
>At least, you did after your feeble attempt at a table collapsed and nailed your shoe to the floor.
>Your table and chair were lower than you were used to, and the table and chairs you kept for guests were higher than ponies were used to.
>Needless to say, it takes some getting used to on both parts.
>You have to stretch your legs out under the table to sit comfortably, and your guests have to jump and clamber on and off of their chairs.
>It's quite entertaining to watch them scramble onto the chairs, since it's roughly the equivalent of a human casually using a chair that puts them four feet off the ground.
>You consider making a salad, before considering that you probably have enough food out.
>Besides, the extent of your culinary skills without instructions is making a sandwich.
>You were somewhat relieved she asked for scrambled eggs. You don't know any other way of preparing them.
>As you finish setting out silverware, you hear the soft impact of hooves and turn to see your guest making her way down the stairs, trembling slightly.
>She's most likely weak from malnutrition and the run earlier.
>Come to think of it, that was probably a poor decision.
>You pull a chair out, before picking up Morning and setting her on it, patting her on the head.
>The locals sometimes complain that you treat them like pets, but you like to blame them. If they didn't want you to pet them and scratch behind their ears, they shouldn't have been so adorable.
>You sit down across from the mare and notice that she hasn't begun eating.
"Feel free to eat as much as you want. It's all fresh, too."
>To drive the point home, you pick a few grapes and toss them into your mouth, before promptly throwing the remaining grapes in a nearby trashcan.
"Everything on the table is probably fresh."
>You see her hesitantly begin to eat her eggs and a pear, as you begin eating as well.
>You should probably make some small talk, but you can't think of what to talk about.
>Work? She's a homeless prostitute. It's probably not something she wants to talk about.
>Family? If she was on good terms with them, she probably wouldn't be homeless.
>Talent? She doesn't have a cutie mark that you could see.
>Weather? Do you have no social skills at all?
>The food? It's a start at least.
"Are you enjoying your sustenance, Glory of the Morning?"
>"Y-yes, sir."
>You've forgotten to give her your name, moron.
"The name to me is Anonymous. Please call me Anon. You may also refer to me as 'Consumer of the Seventh Realm', or as some locals refer to me, 'Get Out of Our Town'."
>She just nods slightly and continues eating.

>The rest of the meal consists of relative silence.
>Your few attempts at starting a conversation were met with silence or curt replies.
>Normally your exaggerated behavior would at least get a giggle from all but the most stoic ponies.
>Your smile falls as you turn away from Glory to clean the dishes.
>What has she gone through if she can't even crack a smile?
>She didn't even seem confused by the things you did.
>Not even a glimmer of curiosity when you began to stack a few apples on top of each other.
>You can scarcely imagine anything that would render one of the bright and cheery ponies so apathetic and defeated happening in ponyland.
>Neither of you brought it up, but you noticed the bruises, and the occasional jagged scar.
>You doubt that any of those were accidents, and it sickens you to think that any ponies of this world would abandon one of their own, let alone beat a starving, homeless mare.
>At least you have the opportunity to make it up to her.
>You force your smile back on as you turn to face Morning.
"All right. Now that that's done..."
>"Please just kill me quickly."
>What.
"What."
>"A-aren't you going to eat me?"
"What?"
>Not this again.
>You thought you dealt with all of these rumors the first few months after your unscheduled move.
>Caught off guard, your act falters as your smile slips from your face.
"Why would I eat anyone that can think? It's much more worthwhile to talk to them."
>"So you're not going to eat me?"
"Of course not. I require you intact for tomorrow. Now, let us be off!"
>You scoop her up in your arms and stroke her silky mane gently as you carry her to your bed.
>As you set her down, she looks at you dejectedly and sighs.
>She probably thinks you brought her here for sex. Silly pony.
"No peeking."
>She turns her head away half heartedly as you strip down to your boxers before putting on a pair of sweatpants.
>She shudders as you climb in the bed next to her and wrap your arms around her.
>You'd have let her have the bed while you slept on the couch, but you've been lonely since you ended up here.
>Not that you needed to get your dick wet, but you really haven't even made any particularly close friends since you ended up here.
>Of course, that's probably because you act like an imbecile, but on the occasion that you haven't, ponies just ended up crossing roads and making up rumors about you abducting foals.
>Your demeanor is certainly disarming, but you normally can't even have an actual serious chat with someone without them flinching if you get to close.
>Hopefully, Morning won't be the same.
>You gently cuddle and nuzzle her as you try to get some sleep.

>You are Morning Glory
>It doesn't seem like Anon is going to eat you or kill you.
>You're not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed.
>You can't seem to make heads or tails of him.
>When he brought you to his bed, you were convinced that he was just like the others who used you.
>You were just hoping that he wasn't like the last stallion that cleaned you up and took you on a "date".
>He acted kind all throughout the meal, only to slam your muzzle into the wall of a nearby alley while viciously pounding you with his penis and hooves alike half an hour later.
>When he was finished, he shoved you down and spit on you before looking at the bruises he'd given you on your flanks.
>"There. Now you have a cutie mark. One fit for a worthless whore like you. What do you say?"
>He stomped on your barrel and once you'd stammered out a "T-thank you, s-sir" left you with a kick to the stomach.
>You'd thrown up your only meal that week from the pain, and once you'd managed to move, you ate your own vomit.
>You'd been glad that you learned how to control your gag reflex a long time ago, otherwise you might have starved that next week.
>You were surprised when Anon merely hugged and snuggled against you, pulling the sheets over you two.
>After several minutes of stiffly waiting for him to do something, you look fearfully over your shoulder to find him asleep.
>You allow yourself to relax with a sigh.
>He seems mentally unstable, and you're afraid of what he might want with you tomorrow.
>At the very least, he doesn't seem violent or cruel, though neither did most of the others.
>For once, you don't feel hunger clawing at your stomach, nor the icy rain soaking through your box.
>You are full and warm, even if you're in the arms of a psychotic "human".
>Maybe this won't be so bad.
>You just hope it lasts for at least a short while.
>Feeling warm and safe, you drift off to sleep with a gentle smile.

>You are Anon
>From the bit of light leaking in from your bedroom window, you estimate it to be early morning.
>Normally, you tend to sleep until mid-morning since you don't really have anywhere to be in the mornings.
>Why are you awake?
>For the same reason you're frozen staring at the wall next to your bed.
>You woke up to the sensation of something brushing against your leg.
>You would have thrown off the blankets to figure out what it was, if not for a certain memory.
>Shortly after you arrived here, you were led to the cottage of an expert on the local fauna.
>They rejected your statement that you weren't from this world as if you were merely a parrot repeating words, and hoped that Fluttershy could identify which part of the local Everfree Forest you came from.
>Fortunately, you managed to clear up that you were intelligent, after several attempts to disagree with a purple mare's stuborn assertions that since you weren't even a well-known animal, you couldn't possibly be sapient.
>She eventually relented after you had to convince her that you were currently holding an argument with her, rather than repeating her own phrases.
>She still doesn't completely accept that you're a member of a species from another reality.
>She's still petitioning that you be classified as a "magical anomaly", rather than an unknown species.
>Anyway, once Fluttershy admitted that she had no idea what you were, your "escorts" left to retrieve a "doctor", who turned out to be a veterinarian, to catalogue you.
>At Fluttershy's insistence that she could handle you, the two of you were left alone in her home.
>After a few minutes of questions regarding humans, she left to take care of something, and insisted that you stay in her living room.
>With few choices, you opted to take a short nap, which was interrupted by the feeling of something moving around your leg.
>Naturally, you panicked and jumped back as a burning pain spread through your leg.
>You yelped and jumped around, shaking your leg, as you realized that something was inside your pants.
>After a minute, it occured to you to remove your pants.
>As you felt your leg being released, you rapidly remove your pants and toss them across the room.
>As you examined the pair of bleeding holes in your thigh, Fluttershy bursts in through the door, asking what happened.
>She looks briefly at you, before staring at the snake weakly slithering from your jeans.
>The others returned shortly after to find you missing your pants and teary-eyed Fluttershy on the other side of the room.
>Needless to say, that was not fun to explain.
>After the two of you managed to assure the onlookers that you were not trying to rape Fluttershy, you tried to ask for some medical attention as your words died in your throat at Fluttershy's glare.
>You spent the next fifteen minutes bleeding on the floor, hoping the snake wasn't particularly venomous, as the mare berated you for scaring "Winston" into biting you and then throwing him across the room.
>The snake turned out to be fine, and fortunately non-venomous, and eventually Fluttershy allowed you to get bandaged up, and ordered you to clean up the puddle of blood on the floor while you "think about what you've done".
>Since then, you've tried to avoid the mare of questionable priorities and snakes.
>You've also woken up regularly at night, convinced something was moving in your bed.
>Normally, you just reassure yourself that there's nothing there, and you try to sleep.
>Right now, you feel something large gently moving next to you, breathing softly and gently brushing against you.
>You very much want to check what is against your back, but your mind has been wandering back through that memory for five minutes.
>If it turns out to be a wolf or something, you don't want it to attack you if you move, though you can't decide whether to be more afraid of whatever's next to you, or Fluttershy's reaction to you "provoking" it.
>As you are contemplating what to do, you hear a sleepy muttering next to you as your memories of last night flood back and you relax.
>You've mentioned your newfound phobias a few times, but anyone you talked to assumed that you were joking as usual.
>To them, most animals were either "cute little critters", "icky bugs", or things that lived in the Everfree, and anyone who hadn't been on the receiving end of one of Fluttershy's tirades couldn't imagine anyone being afraid of her.
>Fortunately, you've gotten it mostly under control, and, if your plan works out, you might have somebody to talk honestly about such things.
>You gently move your guest's hooves as you get out of bed.
>You head blearily to your kitchen as you wonder what to have for breakfast.
>Normally, you'd just have whatever passed for cereal in horseland, but with your guest, you decide to try your hand at pancakes.

>After 45 minutes, you are done cooking the pancakes with only a few mistakes.
>As you search for some syrup, Glory comes running down the stairs, before stopping and staring at you with a sigh.
"Did you miss me?"
>"I *huff* smelled some-*huff*-thing burning."
>As she smiles sheepishly, you realize that she smelled the several pancakes you burned.
>With a huff of mock exasperation, you grab plates and silverware to finish setting the table when you notice her staring at the pancakes with a blush upon her face.
>Puzzled, you follow her gaze to one of the pancakes.
>You had gotten bored and attempted to shape the pancakes with little success.
>Your "elephant" became a blob.
>Your "unicorn" would be put to shame by an infant's scribbles.
>Your "Italy" turned... Oh.
>Well that explains it.
>You'd be confused too if someone was serving dick-shaped pancakes.
>You both take your positions at your table as you begin to place the pancakes on each of your plates, noticing Glory's occasional glance toward the "Italy" pancake.
>You gesture to the condiments as you begin to pour a generous amount of syrup upon your pancakes.
"Feel free to add butter or concentrated maple sap to your food disks."
>"Thank you."
>You hear her mumble out a response as she spreads a small amount of butter on her pancakes.
>When she goes to pour the syrup, you notice the bottle shaking unsteadily and help her weakened hoof to support the weight.
>You note that unlike last night, she doesn't shy away from you as you help her.
>She seems much less tense than last night, and though she doesn't seem relaxed, you can almost notice a faint smile upon her lips.
>For now, you're content to let her open up at her own pace.
>You're pretty sure that she'll be well on her way to improvement once she knows that someone will take care of her, whether she wants it or not.

>Once you've both finished eating and you've rinsed off the dishes, you turn back to see Glory nervously staring down at the table.
"Now, to business!"
>A twinge of pity runs through you at the look of despair forming on the mare's face.
>"W-what do you want me to do, sir?"
"Firstly, don't call me sir. That's not my name. I have no idea why ponies keep thinking my name is 'Sir' or 'Mister'. I'm pretty sure that -- hang on."
>You notice the corners of her mouth twitch upward as you make a show of pulling your ID from your wallet.
"Yep. My name's still Anon. It says so on this card in case I forget."
>You manage to catch a stifled giggle as you put your wallet back in your pocket, before you face her and turn your hamminess up to eleven.
"I, Anonymous, Devourer of Foods, Writer of Words, Breather of Air, being of sound body and questionable mind do hereby declare thee, Morning Glory, Destroyer of Planets, Consumer of Pancakes, to be my Assistant of Tasks!"
>She tries to hide the grin at your actions as you continue.
"Should you accept this most honorable position, you shall be provided with food and shelter, and all the pancakes you can eat!"
>Despite her hesitant smile, you know she has no reason to agree to a stranger's long-term offer out of the blue.
"You may accept or decline the position whenever you wish."
>"W-what do you need my help with, si- Anon?"
"I'm glad you asked!"
>You rush to grab a small toolbox from next to your front door.
>You return to the mare and gesture with the toolbox toward the door as you turn to walk backwards through the door.
"Onward, my fine frie- afsdsk!"
>Everything seems to jolt and spin as you walk into the door frame, before turning to walk forward as you rub the forming lump with your free hand.
"Onward, my assistant!"

>You are Morning Glory.
>This morning, you woke up to the smell of smoke to find Anon trying to make the most horrifically misshapen pancakes you have ever seen.
>You haven't made pancakes or even seen many through the last few years, but you're pretty sure that they shouldn't look more like blobs or penises than circles.
>While you were wondering why anypony would go to such lengths to help you, he declared you his assistant in the most ridiculous manner you could imagine.
>As you watched him walk straight into the doorframe, it occurred to you what was going on.
>He acted ridiculously and childishly, he could barely cook pancakes of all things, seemed to have no idea of how to act properly around others, and hired you to cuddle and be an "assistant".
>He seems well-meaning, but he must be mentally disabled.
>Why else would anypony so obliviously hire a whore, or some worthless pony without a talent to be an assistant?
>He probably doesn't even know what you really are and just wants a friend.
>Part of you feels guilty about taking advantage of the kindness of someone who doesn't really understand what they're doing.
>The enthusiastic smile on his face as he leads you and the warm fullness in your stomach convinces you otherwise.
>He gets a friend, you get to survive on more than scraps.
>Everypony wins.
>A slight smile grows on your face as you unconsciously nuzzle his hip.

>You continue following him with only the occasional stumble until he stops and knocks on the door of one of the houses.
>You hear the clang of falling cookware amidst heavy and uneven hoofsteps before the door opens to reveal a haggard tan mare holding a cup of coffee.
>"What's with all the- Oh, hey Anon. You're early"
>She glances at you with a hint of curiosity before looking up to Anon with a sigh as he replies with a grin.
>"Great sweet-maker Bon-Bon, I have ventured forth from yon hill to repair your cooking machine!"
>With a roll of her eyes, she steps aside and leads you both to her kitchen as she explains that her oven isn't heating evenly or something.
>You don't really follow the conversation, and judging by the number of times you hear "thingy" and a variety of other meaningless words from the human, you doubt he has a clue what is going on.
>As Anon sets his toolbox down and digs around in it, you take the time to look out for your benefactor, whispering worriedly to Bon-Bon.
"I-is the gas off, before he starts?"
>The mare looks at you with the judging gaze of somepony answering the dumbest question they've heard in a week.
>"Of course it's off. D'you think I'm stupid? He knows what he's doing. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do."
>Bon-Bon walks off with a huff of annoyance as you glare at her.
>How can she so callously disregard the safety of somepony?
>In your opinion, Anon shouldn't even be allowed within ten feet of an oven.
>You turn back to Anon with determination in your eyes.
>You're going to help him and look after him so he doesn't hurt himself here, unlike that heartless bitch of a mare who didn't seem to care if your... friend could be injured.
>Yes, that's the right word: "friend".
>He's the only one who's shown you any real kindness in years, and you can't let him get hurt.
>A tear slips through the resolve etched upon your face as you hurry to his side.
>You may not be able to do much, but you will help your only friend in this world as much as you can.
>Anon turns to you with a couple of metal racks and presents them to you.
>"Place these somewhere clean."
>You grab them carefully, and after a moment of contemplation, you set them on a nearby counter.
>You turn back to see your friend with the upper half of his body in the oven.
>You try to calm your quickening breath as you consider that this isn't necessarily the safest way to inspect it.
>What if the gas comes on, and Anon suffocates because you didn't notice that he'd stopped moving?
>What if it ignites and he gets burned, and you have to hold your friend's charred face as the molten fat drips from his flesh and you watch the light fade from his eyes?
>You shake your head to dispel your thoughts and resolve to keep your full attention on Anon until he's done.
>"Could you please hand me the wrench?"
>You nearly jump at the sudden question, and fumble around in his toolbox before passing the first wrench you see to him.
>After a few moments, he hands it back.
>"The socket wrench, I mean. The stick with a hole thingy stuck on it."
>You put the wrench back in the toolbox, and after a short search, you pass him the tool that seems to most match his lacking description.
>"Verily do I thank thee."
>You hear a few ratcheting clicks, followed by a few taps.
>You relax slightly as Anon hums a soft tune, which is soon interrupted by loud metallic thuds.
>Crushing your ears against your head with your hooves, you catch bits of Anon humming peacefully through the ungodly cacophony of metal striking metal.
>With your ears ringing, you are soon greeted with the fortunate sight of Anon holding the socket wrench toward you.
>As you place the wrench back in the toolbox, you slowly become aware that Anon is speaking.
"What?"
>Through the ringing, he seems to be asking for a brown bottle and a rag.
>You manage to find a small, half-empty, brown bottle and a frayed but clean rag and hand them to Anon.
>After a few minutes, Anon emerges from the oven and repacks his toolbox.
>You grab the racks from the counter and carefully place them back in the oven.
>"Excellent, my thoughtful assistant. I had nearly forgotten the cooking slabs."
>As he continues moving the tools you thought you put back correctly, Bon-Bon enters the kitchen in an apron.
>"Is it done yet, Anon?"
>"We have just completed this arduous task, mare of sweets."
>"'kay. Stick around so I can test it. Wait at the table out there."
>Anon and you follow her hoof to a small table in the adjacent room, where you sit and wait for Bon-Bon.
>You hope that your challenged friend hadn't damaged the oven too much, as you habitually scan your surroundings for potential exits.

>After a short period of you trying to figure out what the hell Anon was staring at on a nearby wall, Bon-Bon emerges from the kitchen with a steaming tray of sugary treats.
>Thankfully, she has a noticeable contented smile on her face now as she sets the tray between the two of you.
>"Thank you both. I would've had to close the shop for the day if you hadn't fixed that for me. Have some candy, on me, while I get your payment."
>As she walks off, only one thought runs through your mind: how the hell did Anon, who seems scarcely capable of making pancakes correctly manage to fix an oven by smacking it and Celestia knows what else?
>Whatever.
>At least the two of you wouldn't be run out of the house by a furious mare.
>You let out a sigh of relief as you notice Anon sliding the tray toward you with a goofy smile.
>"Take from the bounty, Morning, you've earned it."
"I didn't do much."
>"Au contraire. Such tasks often take twice the duration to repeatedly lose and find my position when I retrieve mine implements of choice."
>You doubt you made the difference you think he's suggesting, but you'll let him win the argument.
>As you nibble on a peppermint flavored candy, one of Anon's hands pats your head.
>Your muscles slacken while his hand runs through your mane, and you rest your head upon the table with a peaceful sigh as he scratches behind your ears.
>Anon hums a gentle tune as you drift off to sleep, leaning into your friend.

>You are Anon.
>While you were gently petting Morning's head, she drifted off to sleep against you.
>God is she adorable.
>She must still be weak from everything.
>Maybe you pushed her too far, dragging her around so soon after taking her in.
>You'll let her rest the for the remainder of the day.
>You still can't believe that anyone could be cruel to anything this adorable.
>It'd be like kicking a starving kitten into a pond.
>When Bon-Bon steps back into the room, you bring a finger to your mouth and make a small shushing sound before whispering an explanation.
"My new assistant has recently endured a multitude of perilous trials."
>She places a small sum of bits on the table, and while you gather them up, she puts the remaining sweets into a bag before passing them to you.
>Deciding to get out of her hair, you quietly hook a strap to the sides of your toolbox, before tossing the strap over a shoulder and gently grabbing your companion.
>You walk home, gently swaying your smiling friend as you idly run your fingers through her hair.
>You carry her up and tuck her into your bed, before changing into a set of clothes free of oven grease.
>You are nowhere near as exhausted as Glory seems to be, but you can hardly resist her cuteness.
>You grab a book from a nearby shelf and turn back to find Glory lightly tossing in her sleep.
>Poor thing must be having a nightmare.
>You settle into the bed next to her and stroke her back as she relaxes under your touch.
>Shortly after you begin reading, Morning shifts and wraps you in a loose hug, resting her head upon your chest contentedly.
>Looks like you may be here for a while.
>Your face slowly comes to match Morning's peaceful smile as you read, cuddling with one of the closest friends you've made in this world.

>You continue reading and snuggling with Morning for a few hours, listening to the comforting sound of her relaxed breathing.
>Eventually, you set your book down as she shifts and looks up at you sleepily.
>"Anon?"
>You smile at her confusion and scratch her head as you softly explain.
"You fell asleep at Bon-Bon's house. I carried you back here."
>She smiles gently at your words before stretching her legs and freeing you from her embrace.
>While the two of you head to the kitchen for lunch, you note happily that Morning seems to ignore the three-foot bubble of space most other ponies seem to give you.
>Once, you would have been glad for personal space, but after months of little more than the reluctant acceptance of most ponies, having another comfortable enough around you to regularly brush against your legs and hip as you walk side by side makes it difficult to hide your goofy grin.
>Of course, it doesn't hurt that Morning's as adorable as a newborn kitten, and you'd be lying if you said you didn't find her attractive, but knowing that another was glad to be with you was worth more than all of the flank in ponyland.
>Utilizing all of your culinary skills, you select from your extensive repertoire of four lunch foods and decide upon sandwiches.
"Now, what toppings would you like atop your sandwich?"
>"Just some dandelions, lettuce, and tomato, if you have them."
>You pull out two plates, placing bread and lettuce on each.
>You manage to find a few dandelions and put them on her sandwich, putting cheese on yours.
>You'd recalled that dandelions were once considered an easy growing food of convenience brought by some of the early European settlers in America and decided to give them a try a bit ago.
>You have no idea how the settlers prepared them, but your attempt tasted horrible, so you've kept them in case you had a visitor for some reason.
>Of course, Morning's the closest thing you've had to a visitor in months, besides the ponies who occasionally ask you to try your hand at fixing things, since you were both good enough to get most things working and cheaper than a professional.
>Looking around, you don't seem to have any cut tomatos, so you grab a tomato, and set it on a cutting board you pulled from a cupboard.
>When you pull a reasonably sharp knife from a drawer, you catch Morning's eyes widen and hear her breathing a bit heavily.
>Confused, you follow her gaze to the knife in your hand, and after a moment it hits you.
>She must be terrified of knives.
>You could imagine why.
>Living on the streets, she'd probably been threatened at knifepoint, or worse, raped by some asshole with a knife.
>Your thoughts are interrupted before the pity breaks through to show on your face.
>"C-can I cut the tomatoes?"
>She's probably trying to bravely get over her fears to help you in any small way.
>A twinge of empathy runs through you.
>You need her to understand that your kindness isn't dependent on what she can do for you.
>She doesn't need to get over her fears so soon after getting off the streets.
"It's alright. You don't need to--"
>"Let me cut the tomatoes."
>She forcefully interrupts you with a tone that makes it clear that this is not negotiable.
"Alright."
>As you hand her the knife, she gives a sigh that sounds almost relieved.
>Puzzling over this, you pull out various condiments, most of which you've never actually used, and place them on the table as Morning finishes slicing the tomatoes.
>Once she has placed a couple of the slices on each sandwich, you put away the ingredients before joining Morning at the table.
>When you sit, you are happy to see that Morning moves her chair slightly closer to you.
>You're glad that she feels safe around you.
>She deserves it after what she's been through.

>You are Morning Glory.
>You had woken up with Anon in bed earlier.
>You were confused at first, but lying there with him while he read just felt right; you felt safe and happy next to him.
>He'd apparently carried you all the way from Bon-Bon's house after you fell asleep.
>You probably need to work on getting some strength back after so long, but you were comforted by the fact that someone cared that much.
>Most ponies you've met over the last while were perfectly content to leave you bleeding and unconscious in an alley.
>Anon didn't even just wake you up when he could have left you there, he picked you up in his arms and gently brought you back to his home, carefully setting you in a warm bed without waking you.
>You still weren't quite sure what to think of the weird human that took you in, but you felt warm and content just being near him.
>When he took out a sharp knife to cut the tomatoes for your sandwiches, you froze.
>You may have felt safe around him, but that didn't mean you felt safe for him.
>After all, if he could walk straight into a doorframe, and his idea of fixing something with flammable gas was apparently smashing it with a wrench, you don't want to imagine what he could do with a knife.
>You insisted on cutting the tomatoes yourself, but he stubbornly tried to dissuade you.
>Poor thing didn't even understand the danger he could have put himself in with his clumsiness.
>It's a good thing he has you to look after him.
>Yes, that's right.
>You like being around him, and it's much better than being on the streets again.
>You need and like him.
>He needs and seems to like you.
>By the time the two of you finish eating, you have made your decision.
"A-anon, you remember your offer from earlier?"
>"Have you decided upon mine offer of glorious assistant-hood?"
"P-please let me stay with you."
>You look up at him, and as he appears to contemplate your words, fears run through your mind.
>Has he changed his mind?
>He wouldn't pause this long if he was as certain as he seemed this morning.
>As your hope falters, Anon breaks into an excited grin.
>"You may stay here as long as you wish. After your exemplary and unrehearsed performance this morning, I am overjoyed to have you as my assistant."
>You stare blankly for a moment, stunned by his response.
>Throughout the last few years of your life, nopony cared the least about you.
>The only ones who ever even talked to you only wanted to use you as either a punching bag or a cheap lay.
>You even overheard the occasional pony talking about you, remarking how much better the world would be without ponies like you, and the one or two who asked you to your face when you would die in a ditch so the world would be free of such a blight before kicking you to the ground to speed such a death along.
>Now here you were, with a weird alien who has shown you more kindness than you've seen in the rest of your life.
>He took you in for nothing, expected nothing of you and gave you everything you could need.
>He might be different and not the brightest, but for once, you had someone who truly cared about you, someone who made you feel happy and safe just by being there, and he just told you that you would never have to leave.
>You try to blink away the tears as you realize that the nightmare is finally over.
>With an odd warmth blossoming inside, ecstatic at his words, you leap onto him and cry into his shoulder, while he gently pats your back as you choke out the words that you know will never be enough to express how you feel.
"Thank you."

>You are Anon.
>For the past twenty minutes since Morning tried to tackle you out of your chair, you have been holding her as she cried on you.
>More accurately, she's had you in a death grip while you tried to reassure her.
>At first, you were worried that you'd gone too far by pausing before telling her she could stay, but when you caught a glimpse of her face, you saw on her teary face the widest smile you've seen so far on the usually melancholy mare.
>Her crying had trailed off a while minutes ago, and now all you heard from Morning was her contented breathing as she held herself against you.
>Part of you thinks that this should have become awkward some time ago, but the gentle smile on Morning's relaxed face, along with the happiness of having someone here who so desperately wanted to hug you after over a year of the cautious tolerance of the ponies, assures you otherwise.
>Her unrelenting grip lets you know that she hasn't fallen asleep on you this time, she's just glad to be with you.
>However, the gradually growing discomfort encourages you to reluctantly speak up.
"Morning, not to ruin the moment, but could you slacken your grip? I can't feel my arm."
>The apologetic look on her face as she releases you convinces you to reassure her.
"It's alright. Now come on, let's get cleaned up."
>You lightly ruffling her hair with the hand you can still move as she happily leans into your hand.
>The black smudges on her tear-stained face and messy hair cause you to unsteadily wipe the back of your numb hand against your face to find that you've still got grease from the oven on you.
>Seems you both need to get cleaned up.
>You make a note to change your bedsheets later.
>You probably should have checked if you were clean before cuddling with Morning earlier.
>You rinse off the dishes, before leading Morning to your bathroom.
"You may cleanse yourself first, I can go after you."
>Morning takes a step into the bathroom, before hesitantly looking back and making a nervous suggestion.
>"Y-you could join me, Anon?"
>You can feel your face burning as you consider the implications of her words.
"N-no, it's alright."
>"Please?"
>You are certain you are a bright red, as Morning asks you to join her pleadingly.
"I-if you want to..."
>You step nervously into the bathroom, face ablaze, and prepare the bath, trying to delay as much as possible.
>Fortunately, ponies didn't seem to have showers in most homes, so you never had to worry about the height difference.
>As Morning steps into the bathtub, you turn away from her and undress.
>As you nervously remove your shirt, you can feel Morning's eyes burning into your back.
>There are a number of reasons you are so nervous right now.
>You've not had any real relationships here, and you have no idea how ponies do these sorts of things, though you doubt they skip to sex and bathing together this quickly.
>You remove your belt.
>You don't even know if she meant to imply anything sexual.
>As far as you know, she only meant washing each other.
>You drop your pants.
>As far as you know, she might have some degree of PTSD from all that she's been through, and if she doesn't want anything sexual, you might trigger flashbacks or something accidentally.
>You really don't want her to think that you accepted her trusting offer to bathe together only to attempt to force her into sex, especially when she sees that despite your best efforts, you're at half-mast right now.
>You throw your underpants off and jump in the bathtub, bringing your knees to your chest and hiding your steadily growing boner under the layer of soap bubbles atop the water.
>Burning red, you are met with Morning's confused gaze at your actions.
>This may be difficult.

>You are Morning Glory.
>When Anon told you that the two of you would alternate bathing, a thought occurred to you.
>Instead of cleaning up as quickly as possible, and then having to wait for him to finish, why not get clean together?
>His hands would probably make it easier to clean your back, which you always have trouble reaching.
>He could probably use some help as well.
>You don't know how well he can clean himself alone, especially since he's been smearing grease over everything since this morning without even seeming to notice.
>When he finally agreed, you were puzzled to find yourself relieved.
>After the past day, and the months before, the prospect of being alone again, even for a short time, was terrifying.
>Anon's crimson face as he removes his clothes confounds you.
>What's so embarrassing about taking a bath?
>You haven't really seen him without clothes, so maybe he has scars he wants to keep hidden?
>You continue watching as he undresses, with your confusion only growing as his body appears quite normal besides the lack of a coat.
>What else would stallions be ashamed of about their bodies?
>You've only met a few shy or embarrassed stallions on the streets, so you only can think of a few reasons.
>Maybe he has a really small penis that he's embarrassed about?
>Maybe humans have something really weird, like a tentacle for a dick?
>Actually, how do you even know Anon has a penis?
>You don't know how humans work.
>Come to think of it, you're not entirely sure that Anon's a guy.
>Maybe humans don't have genders, or the females are strong with deep voices.
>Pondering how little you know about humans, you nearly miss Anon remove his underwear and barely catch a glimpse of him before he jumps into the bathtub.
>From what you could just barely see, you can certainly confirm that Anon is a male.
>In fact, he wasn't too different from ponies.
>The only real big differences you saw were that he didn't seem to have a sheathe and that he seemed a bit larger than most stallions when they weren't excited.
>You stare at Anon, trying to cover himself with bubbles.
>You've got no idea what he's embarrassed about.
>You've seen some stallions that don't get much bigger than that.
>Of course, you've also seen some who get quite large.
>Obviously, he could also be hard, which would put him on the smaller end, but he hasn't given any indication he sees you like that.
>Anypony interested in somepony like you only really wanted a cheap fuck, and he's too caring for that.
>You are surprised to realize that you found your glimpse of his exotic penis mildly intriguing.
>You shake your head as you remind yourself that you are just friends.
>You doubt he sees you in that way, though.
>Considering his often childish behavior, you doubt he really knows about sex anymore than a foal.
>The thought of accidentally driving away your only friend makes you hesitant to do any more than hug him.
>Besides, you aren't going to take advantage of anypony with the mental state of a foal.
>You stop staring at Anon and you both start cleaning yourselves.

>Soon, you've gotten all of the spots you can easily reach.
>You look up to see Anon bending his arms at odd angles to wash his back.
>How does he think he can clean where he can't even see?
"L-let me help."
>As you bring a washcloth to his back, Anon tenses slightly.
>He slowly loosens as you stroke the cloth around his smooth skin.
>He lets out a relaxed sigh while you continue, and you hear a contented groan as you rub the tensed muscles of his back.
>When you lean your body against his to get a better reach, you hear his breath hitch as he tenses again.
>He must really be shy about his body.
>Maybe that's why he wears clothes all the time?
>You doubt that anypony would mind if he didn't cover himself up so much.
>You certainly wouldn't mind if Anon wanted to get more comfortable.
>"O-okay, I'm good."
>He gently pushes you off of him, and you notice he has returned to a bright red as his eyes avoid yours.
>Poor guy.
>He's probably so nervous because he's different from everypony else around here.
>Maybe other ponies teased him?
>You know how cruel ponies can be to anypony different, and you owe it to him to make him feel comfortable being himself, rather than hiding his body all the time.
>You can work on it while you're "assisting" and looking after him.
>He's helped you more than you could have asked for, this is the least you can do for him.
"Can you help wash my back?"
>"Y-yeah."
>He stiffly moves toward you, keeping much of his body submerged.
>When his hands find you, you melt into a pool of bliss as he cleans your coat, removing whatever remains of months of filth.
>Anon scratching your head scarcely compares to his ministrations as he works over the years of tenseness in your body.
>As his hands run over your hips, you release a low moan, lost to the pleasure of his massage.
>You readjust your legs to keep yourself upright.
>You hazily register your leg brush against something stiff as Anon grunts and shifts slightly.
>"T-there. D-done."
>You soon return to your senses as Anon releases you from a world of bliss.
>You see that Anon has moved to the opposite side of the tub, and his crimson face is avoiding your eyes again.
>As you wonder why he stopped, you notice that the layer of bubbles has thinned, and see his hardened manhood under the water.
>For some reason, the thought of it being Anon's makes it more arousing and exotic than any stallion's you've seen.
>You can feel yourself blushing and grinning giddily at the thought that Anon likes you and finds you attractive.
>You try to control your expression before Anon looks up, though the idea of somepony as kind as Anon liking anypony like you, despite all that you've been through, makes it difficult.
>Regardless of this development, you refuse to take advantage of your friend and use him for sex as stallions have used you.
>You pretend to have seen nothing to avoid embarrassing him as you rinse the soap from your coat.
>You rise from the tub and dry yourself off, deciding to give Anon some time to himself.
"T-thank you, Anon. I'll be downstairs when you're done."
>You leave to give your friend some privacy.

>You are Anon.
>As Morning closes the bathroom door behind her, you sigh in relief.
>You had just gotten your disobedient dick under control when she had started washing your back.
>You wouldn't have imagined that someone else washing and massaging you would feel so good, but it was quickly getting uncomfortable as you ended up getting hard again.
>When you started cleaning her, you tried to massage her, and apparently it worked, because her moans brought your boner back full force.
>You hadn't gotten any action since you ended up in ponyworld, and her vocalizations of pleasure were quite arousing.
>When one of her hooves accidentally brushed against your dick, you nearly came right then and there.
>In fact, you're still rock hard right now.
>After a minute of deliberation, you get up and lock the bathroom door, before getting out of the tub and grabbing a tissue.
>Imagining Morning moaning as you grasp and massage her flank, you slowly stroke your shaft.
>As you envision Morning looking back at you with half-lidded eyes, licking her lips mid-moan, waves of pleasure run through you as you immediately cum.

>You are Morning Glory.
>After leaving Anon to allow his problem to subside without embarrassing him more, you don't know what to do.
>You've only been in Anon's house for a day, so you don't know if there's anything you can do besides waiting for him.
>Actually, it might be a good idea to explore a bit, since you only know of four rooms in his house.
>Searching downstairs, you find the kitchen and living room, as well as a closet and the entrance to a nearly empty basement.
>You head upstairs, passing the bathroom with a faint blush.
>There are only three other doors up here.
>The first is a small closet with some cleaning supplies.
>The second is a small room, which looks like a guest bedroom, though it lacks a bed.
>The third is the bedroom you're already familiar with.
>Well, only a few minutes and you've already exhausted that option.
>Idly looking around the room, you notice the book that Anon was reading earlier.
>It's probably some light reading, like a teen novel or something.
>Well, reading it would at least give you something to do while waiting for your friend.
>You pick up the book disinterestedly and begin reading.
>"The majority of the local fauna of the Everfree have been adversely affected by these local thaumaturgic perturbations of primarily unknown origin, though several species have evolved a variety of complex adaptations, their ancestral roots scarcely visible and often determined primarily from vestigial traits in autopsies."
>What. The. Fuck.
>You could barely tell what that sentence said, let alone what it meant.
>You flip frantically through the pages.
>Apparently this entire book is an academic text on the Everfree Forest, written in dry, dense language.
>You sit, staring at the words in front of you.
>Was Anon really reading this?
>Maybe he was looking at the pictures?
>No, there were barely any pictures, and most were heavily labelled diagrams.
>Does that mean that he really was reading this?
>You would have a hard time reading even a few pages of this and feigning interest.
>Maybe he just has a large vocabulary?
>He does speak oddly.
>But why would he read something like this, then?
>Does he just enjoy casually reading difficult texts on scholarly topics?
>If he is so intelligent, why does he acts so clueless and erratic constantly?
>This just doesn't fit together.
>You sigh and drop the book, looking up to see Anon standing in the doorframe with a towel around his waist.
>"I have finished the cleansing rituals."
>There.
>No one talks like that.
>He clearly has a well-developed vocabulary, but no one speaks or acts in such a manner.
>Anon enters the bedroom and pulls various articles of clothing from the dresser.
>He turns away from you and drops the towel as he begins to dress quickly.
>His reluctance to appear undressed in front of you only cements the oddity in your mind.
>Maybe it's just something with humans?
>He doesn't seem to remember the mirror atop the dresser beside him, and as he dresses, you get a good look at Anon's manhood.
>It's odd, but while stallion dicks remind you of all the times you were roughly fucked and left in an alley, the sight of Anon instead reminds you of all of the times he's cared for you.
>You find the sight of his exotic penis oddly arousing, and as you observe its smooth head, its shaft, and the bit of short hair at its base, you find your cheeks heating up.
>Unbidden, your mind wanders to how he would use it, gently caressing your body with his wonderful hands while he gently makes love to you, slowly pumping his shaft into your pussy, as he breathily whispers that he loves you into your ear before bringing his lips to yours.
>You shake your head to dispel these thoughts.
>You're just friends with Anon, though the drop of liquid on the inside of your thigh reminds you that you wouldn't mind that changing.
>As your flushed face returns to its normal coloration, Anon finishes dressing and turns around.
>"What shall we do now?"
>You stare, dumbstruck for a moment.
>This is the first time he's asked you for options, rather than dragging you off somewhere.
>What do you want to do?
>You want him to gently set you on the bed before lovingly kissing down toward--
>No.
>You want to have him softly rub your head with one hand while his other goes to your--
>Stop it.
>Your marehood heats up as you frantically struggle to think of a nonsexual suggestion.
>Maybe he could caress you on a blanket in the park under the stars, before gently rubbing his manhood along your--
>No.
>Wait.
>You could go to the park.
>It's not the best idea, but it's better than the others.
"Could we go to the park?"
>"A wonderful idea!"
>His grin widens as he scoops you up and walks to the door.
>Before you can protest, his hands begin their familiar journey through your mane and coat.
>Any complaints about your current position subside as you nuzzle into his hand while he carries you.
>You barely notice when he stops to open the door.
>As he carries you to the park, you rub your face into his chest, lulled into relaxation by his comforting scent.
>A smile and blush take hold of you, unseen by your friend, at the thought of how he's carrying you, as softly and soothingly as a lover.
>You sigh contentedly in his embrace as you allow him to carry you to the park.

>As he walks, he hums a tune with no discernable pattern, as if it were a number of separate songs stitched together.
>For once, you don't particularly care if anyone's watching or staring.
>They used to give you looks of disgust that made you avoid going out in the daylight.
>Now?
>Let them stare.
>What do they have to see, besides a happy mare in the arms of the closest friend she's had in years?
>After a few minutes, you are roused from your relaxation as Anon gently sets you on a bench before sitting next to you.
>As his hand scratches the spot you could never reach behind your ears, it strikes you that you know quite little about your new friend.
"Anon? What is it you actually do? I mean, your job?"
>He pauses a moment in thought before answering.
>"I perform miscellaneous tasks which many ponies lack the knowledge and dexterity for. Mostly small repairs."
>Well, that explains fixing Bon-Bon's oven earlier.
"What kinds of things?"
>"This morning we fixed an oven, yesterday I helped move a refrigerator, the day before I fixed a hole in a wall. I complete many tasks which require some skill, though none requiring an expert."
"That's a lot of things."
>"Unlike ponies, humans don't really have special talents. Many of us are sufficient in many types of tasks."
>You had heard of other species who don't have cutie marks, although you hadn't met any.
>Knowing that Anon had a decent life without a special talent gave you an odd sort of hope.
>After hearing everpony's comments on your blank flank, you'd assumed that you would never have any worthwhile talents.
>Maybe you don't need a cutie mark to have a good life.
>Maybe you can be like your friend.
"What kind of things do you like to do for fun?"
>"I greatly enjoy relaxing and learning from the great paper receptacles of knowledge. They are helpful and entertaining."
>You think that means he likes reading.
"What kinds of things do you like reading?"
>"I particularly find favorable non-fiction and history. I enjoy reading fictional narratives, though the events of this reality often approximate those fictional works of my world. Our fiction was filled with the magic and sorcery lacking in our reality."
>That makes sense.
>If you ended up in a world that seemed right out of fiction, you'd enjoy its history.
>You sigh and lie your head on Anon's lap while his hand runs along your back.
>This world seems cruel and what little history you can remember from school as a foal seemed boring to you.
>Your friend is a lot more like a pony than you expected.
>He's just got a bunch of small talents, a larger heart than anypony you've ever known, and a weird way of talking.
>Your face scrunches up a little in contemplation as you wonder whether to ask why he talks oddly.
>Will he be offended?
>Would he think you were being rude?
>Would he hate you for asking?
>As you lean into his hand scratching along your neck, the worry drops from your face.
>Anon is the most wonderful person you've known.
>He wouldn't get offended so easily.
"A-anon? W-why do you always talk funnily?"
>His hand freezes in place as you feel him tense up.
>The worry returns as you hope you didn't just ask the wrong question.

>You are Anon.
>After knowing you for only a day or so, Morning has just asked you the one question you let everyone else assume the answer to.
>How do you answer her?
>You could pretend you have no idea what she's talking about, but she wouldn't buy that for long.
>If you told her the truth, and let her get to know you, what would happen?
>You aren't an idiot, you still notice the occasional suspicious glances and the few ponies that cross the street to avoid you.
>The ponies that don't outright fear you only accept you uneasily because you seem too incompetent to be any threat.
>Maybe Morning will be different?
>She's undoubtedly seen what ponies are capable of.
>She's been grateful and ecstatic about what you've done so far.
>After all she's been through herself, she probably won't judge you or fear you for being different.
>Besides, you've been lonely without anyone willing to seriously listen to you without quivering in fear and discomfort, besides that creepy mint-colored unicorn that keeps staring at your hands.
>Morning has been closer to you than anyone else here.
>You hope you can trust her with your hesitant answer.
"Because some ponies find it funny, and it keeps the rest from freaking out all the time? It's somewhat fun, too."
>She just stares at you quizzically, and you continue rambling.
"A lot of ponies are afraid of other species. When I first ended up here, I was nearly thrown in a dungeon until they could figure out if I was a threat, almost run out of town by a angry mob soon after, and nearly arrested twelve times in the first month. I figured if they thought I was just some weird, crazy guy, they'd let me live here."
>Her continued blank stare prompts you on.
"'Cause, most people can't be really confused and afraid or angry at the same time, so I thought that if I seemed goofy and harmless, they wouldn't be afraid. It'd be better to be an outcast than thrown in prison, or exiled into some forest, or--"
>"That's silly, Anon. You don't have to pretend around me."
>Her gentle smile, rather than the fear part of you expected, calms you as you meet it with your own.
>You pull her into a soft embrace and rub her back, as you whisper into her ear.
"Thank you."
>Morning melts into your arms as you gently massage her, before stiffening slightly when your hands wander lower.
>You note to avoid her hips before you make things more awkward, and she relaxes as you continue.

>After a few hours, you wake from your impromptu nap to find Morning lying against your chest.
>Her ear twitches adorably as you hold each other in a mutual embrace.
>Her calm breathing and slight smile as she sleeps leave you content to stay there and let your cute friend rest.
>You slowly trail your hand along her back, careful not to wake her.
>You gladly lie there with her for nearly half an hour.
>Just seeing her sleeping in your arms calms you and brings a smile to your face.
>However, soon her breathing increases as her face slowly scrunches up in what seems like pain.
>She must be having a nightmare.
>You'd hate to imagine what her nightmares must be like after what she's been through.
>Comfortingly, you rub her shoulders, whispering gently in her ear that she's alright.
>"...A-anon..."
>She mutters out your name as she pants faster and squirms in your arms.
>Worried, you embrace her more tightly and continue to massage along her back, whispering softly.
"It's okay. You don't have to be scared, Morning. I'll be here for you."
>"...Anon!"
>She whimpers and shudders with a pained expression.
>Her breathing soon begins to slow as she wakes to your whispers of comfort, before she looks up at your worried expression.
>Seeing her panting with a red face and the hint of tears in her eyes almost tangibly hurts.
>Meeting your eyes for a moment, she looks down in shame.
>You're never going to let this mare suffer any more than she already has.
>You comfort her as your hands rub her back and scratch her head.
"Shh. It's alright."
>She looks up to you, hope sparkling in her eyes.
"We all have bad dreams. I'm not going to let anyone hurt you."
>Her face flushes at your words.
"Come on. We should start heading back home."
>Morning reluctantly releases you, and stands as red as a tomato, avoiding your eyes.
>A slight dampness on your leg helps solidify the reason for her embarrassment.
>She'd just had a nightmare, presumably about her time on the streets, and it was frightening enough that she ended up sweating all over you, and potentially peeing a little in her sleep.
>Poor thing.
>As you walk home, your hand finds its way to scratch her head.
>She moves to pull away, but after a moment leans into your hand as you walk.

>You are Morning Glory.
>Despite all that you've been through, this has been one of the most embarrassing moments of your life.
>It started in what was apparently just a dream.
>You were nestled into Anon's arms on a park bench, each of you just enjoying the safe warmth of another who wouldn't harm them.
>You broke the silence with your heartfelt sentiment.
"I'm glad I met you, Anon."
>He just smiled before he responded.
>"I am glad to have met you, Morning."
>His speech was still a little off, but you were delighted he was opening up for you.
>You'd never felt more accepted in your life.
"Anon?"
>He turned to look into your eyes.
"I think I love you."
>A grin stretched across his face as he pulled you tighter and whispered in your ear.
>"I love you, Morning Glory."
>Your ecstatic expression was soon cut short when Anon's lips gently met yours.
>The surprise slowly melted from your face as the two of you kissed tenderly, before you both opened your mouths.
>Slowly and lovingly, his tongue caressed yours as you explored each others' mouths for what seemed like hours before you both pulled away.
>As you caught your breath, his hands gently rubbed down your back, before softly stroking your thigh.
>You felt your marehood already hot and wet, a drop of your arousal already on the bench.
>As one of his hands gently moved to the inside of your thigh, his other slowly traced along your abdomen.
>You shuddered in anticipation as his hands gradually made their way, stroking just around the edges of your marehood.
>No stallion had ever made you feel like this before.
>Guilt rooted itself in your mind, as you recalled everything that they had done, everything that they had called you.
>The pegasus who had savagely pounded your vagina, before leaving you covered in mud.
>"Stop stinking up our streets, whore!"
>The unicorn that'd had a BDSM fetish, who had whipped you for an hour before leaving you tied up in an alleyway.
>"Get the fuck out of my store, you slut."
>The stallion that had forcefully ravaged your anus as you had cried and begged for him to stop, nearly ripping your mane out before leaving you sobbing behind a dumpster without paying.
>"You should do us all a favor, and die already."
>Anon's confused look met your tear-filled eyes when your hooves moved down to stop his hands.
"Y-you shouldn't want me. I'm just a whore. I've been fucked by a hundred stallions! I'm just an ugly piece of garbage."
>His hand forced you to look into his concern-filled eyes.
>"I think you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. You are the most wonderful pony I've met, the one who really accepted me, and there is no one I'd rather love."
>He wiped your tears away before pulling you into a gentle kiss.
>Fresh tears of joy ran down your face as you pulled away with a smile.
>As you looked up to your lover, only one thing comes to mind.
"Anon, I want you."
>You released his hands, as he brought you back into a kiss.
>His hands danced just around your flower as your tongues explored.
>You felt his tongue gently caress your gums and brush against your teeth, as your tongue moved along his teeth, the sharp cusps increasing your excitement.
>You pulled away with a slight moan of pleasure as his hand finally met your dripping pussy.
>As his hand slowly worked your vulva in ways none had ever done for you, you scarcely noticed his other hand removing his pants.
>The bliss his hand provided radiated throughout your pelvis as only one thought filled your mind.
>You needed him, now.
"Please, Anon."
>As you spread your hind legs you saw Anon's throbbing manhood emerge as he finished discarding his clothing.
>His hands pulled away from your crotch and pulled you into a loving kiss.
>You gasped involuntarily as you felt the head of his penis meet the folds of your marehood.
>His hands rubbed gently along your back as he slowly entered you.
>You moaned into his mouth as the two-fold joy of being one with your love and of his shaft tenderly dragging along your walls.
>As your fluid slowly soaked your groins, you felt him slowly entering and exiting you, in sharp contrast to the stallions who would roughly and uncaringly plow you hard and fast.
>This wasn't fucking for the sake of sex, it was kind and gentle love.
>His mouth left yours to whisper lovingly in your ear, though you could barely understand him through the haze of pure bliss flowing through you.
>One of his hands left your back and you felt a jolt and shuddered as he began to caress your clitoris.
>Your breath hitched in your throat as you called out your lover's name.
"A-anon!"
>He embraced you more tightly as you were lost, adrift in a sea of pleasure with the only one who mattered to you.
>You twitched involuntarily as his touch ran through you like electricity.
>You could barely concentrate enough to feel him gently plunge into your dripping lips through your ecstasy.
>A feeling that you hadn't felt in a long time welled up inside you.
"I'm *ha* going to--"
>Anon pulled you more tightly into his embrace, still massaging your back, as he sensuously whispered something you barely caught into your ear.
>"It's okay."
>At that moment, he buried himself deeply inside you as the waves of ecstasy rushed through your body.
"Anon!"
>Your orgasm was stronger than anything you'd felt before as you tightly clenched rhythmically around your love's member.
>You scarcely felt the copious amounts of liquid running down from you as the bliss of being joined with Anon overcame you.
>You could hardly breathe as your limbs twitched in this glorious feeling.
>Panting, you looked up into your lover's eyes to see him looking confused.
>Noticing that he was still dressed, you were mortified.
>You just dreamed about having sex with your friend on his lap.
>Ashamed, you couldn't meet his eyes, until he reassured you that it was alright.
>You looked up in hope, but when you found out he thought you had a nightmare, you only felt guilt as you headed home.
>Here he was, worried about you, while you're taking advantage of your friend's kindness and dreaming about having sex with him.
>When his hand meets your head as you walk, you pull away a bit.
>You don't deserve someone like Anon.
>He's shown you kindness and all you can think about is fucking him.
>He's your only friend.
>The only one who cares about you.
>You won't mess this up.
>You lean back into his hand as you walk back home.

>You soon arrive home, wiping the mud from the previous night's rain from your hooves and feet before entering.
>Once inside, Anon chuckles when your stomach rumbles, before turning to meet your blushing face with a mirthful question.
>"Now, what would you like for dinner?"
>What would you like?
>Honestly, after eating scraps out of dumpsters for so long, anything would be nice.
>You can barely even remember more than a few kinds of food anymore.
>What is a dinner food?
>Spaghetti.
>You remember that.
>As you open your mouth to answer, a thought occurs to you.
>Anon has done so much for you in such a short time.
>You should repay him.
>No, you want to repay your friend in some way for what he's given you.
"Can I make spaghetti?"
>"You don't have to--"
>You cut him off before he can protest further.
"I want to."
>"Alright. I can prepare the sauce, if you like, Head Chef Morning Glory."
>A short giggle escapes your lips at his remark as you play along.
"Be my guest, Assistant Chef Anon."
>After searching through his cupboards, you manage to find some spaghetti and pre-prepared sauce.
>It's a good thing, too, since you doubt either of you know how to make either from scratch.
>You turn around to find Anon setting a small pot next to a larger pot filled with water on the stove.
>You bring the spaghetti and sauce over to the pots, playfully brushing against your friend's leg as you pass him.
>As you empty the spaghetti into the larger pot, Anon dumps some of the sauce into the smaller one next to you.
>After Anon ignites the stove, you spend the next several minutes occasionally stirring your respective pots.
>While you idly lean against him with a peaceful smile, you notice him looking at the spaghetti every few minutes.
>Catching your curious glance, he proceeds to justify himself.
>"One of the last times I made pasta, it ended up as a paste. I'm just making sure this doesn't turn out the same."
>You giggle at the thought and continue stirring with a grin next to your friend.
>Soon, you both finish preparing dinner.
>As Anon sets the table, you debate suggesting that you share a plate, before shaking your head.
>You shouldn't rush into things, especially since you're just friends.
>The two of you sit side-by-side as you eat, Anon's hand occasionally reaching down to stroke your mane.
>Partway through dinner, you start a conversation.
"So, that book you were reading, it's about the Everfree Forest?"
>His eyes light up as he answers you.
>"Yeah. It's an interesting place. It has more significant locations than almost any other place in Equestria, and most of the resident species of its ecosystem aren't even found anywhere else!"
>He continues enthusiastically speaking about the wildlife and histories about the nearby forest as you listen, captivated, throughout much of dinner.
>You barely understand much of what he says, but the parts you do seem fascinating and punctuated by his occasional jokes.
>Seeing him genuinely happy discussing the hobbies he probably never talks about with anypony brings an elated grin to your face as he talks.
>Soon, you both finish eating as Anon stops his gleeful speech and scratching, much to your disappointment.
>As he cleans the dishes, he makes a suggestion.
>"We should probably clean the mud off and stuff before we do anything else."
>You know there's pretty little mud on either of you, and that he's probably covering for what he thinks was your "accident" earlier.
>You can still feel the hairs matted down with your secretions on your inner thigh.
>Remembering his massage the last time you bathed, you make your own suggestion.
"C-can you help me get clean again?"
>He fumbles the pot he was washing before stammering back.
>"Y-yeah. Sure. I-i just have to finish here, and change the bedsheets before I forget. Feel free to get started without me."
>You head to the stairs, brushing your tail along his leg as you pass him and just catching a slight blush on his face as you leave the kitchen.
>As you prepare the bath for the two of you, you hear Anon pass by the bathroom on his way to the bedroom.
>You are filled with excitement at the prospect of doing what now seems an intimate activity with him.
>A goofy smile crosses your face as you giggle.
>Maybe you'll get to see his penis again.
>Your crotch slowly heats up as you fantasize.
>Maybe he'll slip and fall on top of you, his erect shaft touching your marehood.
>Maybe he'll passionately kiss you as he slowly enters--
>No.
>Get a hold of yourself, Morning.
>Anon probably sees you as just a friend, and you're fine with that.
>He's the most gentle and kind being you've ever met.
>If he's happy and you're by his side, you're glad to be his friend.
>But what if he'd want to be something more?
>You settle in the tub, sprawling out in relaxation as you imagine what it would be like.

>You are Anon.
>The way Morning's been acting since you started preparing dinner brought a concern to your mind, which was only cemented when she asked you to bathe with her and ran her tail along your leg.
>You've been thinking about it since you started washing the dishes.
>For only having known you for less than two days, she's grown very attached to you.
>You aren't a psychologist, but you'd wager that making a stranger an integral part of your life so quickly isn't particularly healthy.
>She probably latched on to you since you were the only kind person she's met in a long time.
>You hope it doesn't develop into an obsession or anything like that.
>You like her, and maybe you've become attached quickly too.
>You were both alone, and you both need each other.
>You wouldn't dare even dream of abandoning her, and judging by how she's been acting, she wouldn't leave you either.
>You continue contemplating as you replace the oil-covered bedsheets.
>Maybe you just need to encourage her to have a few hobbies and make a few other friends?
>Then again, much of that advice could apply to you, and it hasn't worked too well so far.
>Would it really be so bad for the two of you to mutually depend on each other?
>You could stay together and be there for each other.
>Something strikes you as you pause and repeat your last thoughts.
>Isn't that love?
>Do you love Morning?
>You resume changing the sheets as you sort out your feelings.
>You certainly wouldn't mind being around her for a long time.
>She listens and doesn't judge you for being different, and a smile always comes to your face when you think of her.
>Morning's the only one you've been open with, and seems genuinely glad when you're yourself.
>You're happier than you've been in months around this cute mare.
>A grin stretches your face as you imagine candlelit dinners, sleeping out under the stars in each other's arms, passionately making out in bed.
>You certainly wouldn't mind being in a relationship with Morning.
>There's no one in this world you'd rather be with.
>But you don't know if she sees you that way.
>You've just met, and you're not even the same species.
>After her horrific time on the streets, you can only hope that she wouldn't have a panic attack at the mere thought of sex.
>You refuse to hurt her.
>Besides, you're happy just being with her.
>There's no need to push her into a relationship if she doesn't want one.
>You're content to be friends, though you suppose you wouldn't mind that changing if she wanted it.
>With your thoughts sorted, you make your way to the bathroom.
>As you enter, you are immediately greeted by the sight of Morning cutely sprawled out in the bathtub, clearly content.
>More specifically, you're treated to a view of her marehood between her spread legs.
>Your blush grows as you find yourself unable to look away from her lovely lips, extending slightly from the skin of her crotch.
>Your eyes trail along her reddened labia to the slight bulge where part of her clitoris was just barely visible behind her lips.
>When she shifted slightly, you tore your eyes away from her and turned away to hide your growing erection.
>What the fuck were you just doing?
>What if she had seen you taking advantage of her position to sneak a peek?
>Your boner subsides as you berate yourself.
>As you finish undressing, Morning looks up to see you with sleepy, half-lidded eyes that nearly threaten to undo your self-control.
>"Come on in, Anon."
>Morning rises as you cautiously enter the tub, crossing your legs slightly and sitting sideways.
>As she sits and faces you, a slight look of hurt forms on her face.
>"T-there's no need to be uncomfortable, Anon."
>The sadness on her face convinces you to reluctantly turn to face her and uncross your legs.
>The position is somewhat awkward, as you can't extend your legs without Morning having to sit on them, but at least she doesn't seem to be looking at your exposed manhood.
>She still looks a little disappointed.
>"L-lie down and relax."
"I can't. The bathtub isn't long enough."
>She just looks at you in contemplation for a few seconds before taking hold of one of your legs.
>Your nervousness increases tenfold, but you allow her to move your leg, fighting the slight urge to kick her off.
>She pulls each of your legs out to the full length of the tub, stepping around them as she walks over them toward you.
>"N-now just lie back."
>Morning gently presses a hoof on your chest and you hesitantly comply and lie down in the tub.
>You are suddenly surprised as she lies upon your chest and sighs into your neck.
>You manage not to move as you feel her lower abdomen rest on your thigh.
>She nuzzles you as you lie frozen.
>You've been in this position before, but never naked.
>At the very least, Morning seems completely comfortable like this.
>Slightly encouraged, you hesitantly bring your hands to her head and slowly rub
>She releases a low sigh as you scratch and clean her, slowly working your way through her mane and down her neck.
>As your hands run along her back, her low groans encourage you and bring a light blush to your face.
>Her breathing increases slightly as you wash her flank, fighting to keep control as your hands flow over her hips.
>You feel an slight pulsing where her abdomen meets your thigh every few seconds that you can't quite place.
>You gently clean her hind legs as she grips you more tightly.
>Soon, you need to softly pull her front legs from you as you clean them.
>Your hands work their way between you to wash her chest as she lets out low moans in your ear.
>As your hands move lower, they brush a slight protrusion as Morning gasps.
>Blushing madly, you quickly finish brushing her.
"T-there you go."
>When she shifts to look curiously at you, your diamond-hard erection brushes against her thigh as her eyes widen in surprise.
>Your face feels as if it's burning as you apologize and try to turn away from her.
"S-sorry."
>Her hoof gently turns your face to face her as she quietly stutters out a surprising statement.
>"I-i don't mind..."
>Her reddened face matches yours as you both look away from each other.
>Her leg brushing against your shaft causes you to gasp as you turn to see Morning staring hungrily down at you.
>"I s-sort of like you."
>You can only lie there, stunned, as her eyes close and she slowly brings her lips to yours.
>Your own eyes close in happiness while you gently kiss her.
>There's no tongue.
>This isn't a rough passionate kiss, but a soft kiss of love.
>As she pulls away, her face burns brightly as she nervously tries to stammer out an explanation.
>"I-i-i-i--"
>Your mind is already made up.
"Morning?"
>She looks down at your face fearfully, starting to tear up at the possibility of rejection.
"Would you like to be my marefriend?"
>She stares at you in shock, her mouth flapping before she throws herself into an embrace.
>"Yes!"
>She releases you after a minute and looks at you with a smile and tears of joy before her lips slowly descend to meet yours.
>As you gently kiss, you pull each other closer, desperate for more of each other.
>You feel her tongue softly poke at your lips and open to allow her in.
>As your tongues explore the other's mouth, Morning shifts and begins to grind herself against your leg as she rubs your manhood with one of her rear legs.
>You moan into each other's mouth as pleasure from the make-out session and below radiate through your bodies.
>Soon, she pulls away from you, panting, as her half-lidded eyes look into yours, your faces still connected with a thin string of saliva.
>As she backs away and lowers her muzzle to your cock, she is stopped by your hand and looks up at you confused.
"I want to do something for you, too. Turn around."
>Her confusion is replaced by a sultry grin as she turns and shakes her dripping flank in front of your face.
>You bring your hands up to meet the lips you were previously admiring as they slowly drip viscous fluid on you.
>While you gently trace around her beautiful flower, the earlier pulsing makes sense as you see a little bud rhythmically presenting itself.
>She shudders and her breath hitches as your fingers meet the edge of her lips, before you gasp as her tongue gently licks your frenulum, giving you a good breath of the intoxicating scent of her arousal.
>Barely able to think, you quickly reach your tongue out to trace around her vulva, before slowly dragging your tongue along her lips from bottom to top as her legs give out in pleasure.
>Her marehood is forced onto your face, and you writhe gently in bliss as her mouth engulfs your glans.
>Months without any action has left you very sensitive, and you scarcely remember to continue licking up the erotic syrup dripping into your mouth as her tongue expertly dances around your head as she lowers herself on your manhood.
>You carefully push your tongue into her slit through the haze as she gently moans around your shaft, the sensation causing your legs to tense up as you groan into her pussy.
>She slowly moves on your shaft as your tongue drags gently along the inside of her.
>She moans each time her winking clitoris brushes against your tongue, the vibrations massaging your shaft bringing you closer to the edge.
>The sound of each of you panting when you breathe only fuels you further as you press your lips to her lower lips and work your way around them.
>As her moans increase, she stretches out her tongue to caress your scrotum as the back of her mouth repeatedly contracts around your head as she swallows your precum.
>Unable to hold on much longer, you moan into her involuntarily as you speed up your movements as her winking increases.
>The wonderful liquid dripping from her marehood suddenly gush forth as she rhythmically squeezes your tongue.
>You hear a long, loud moan as Morning suddenly shoves her mouth all the way down around you.
>The sensations running through you like lightning along with the erotic sounds are too much to bear, and you are lost in a blissful haze as you cum hard in Morning's mouth as she swallows around you.
>The two of you can scarcely think through the pleasure, but you both greedily gulp down the liquid arousal you offered each other.
>After nearly a minute, the sensations have died down to the point where you've regained some control.
>Morning's thighs release your head and you both collapse and relax.
>Your faces find their way free, as you both softly pant.
>After a few minutes, you've both caught your breath, and she shakily gets up and turns around, looking dreamily into your eyes.
>Her legs release her onto your chest as she pulls you into a gentle kiss.
>You can both taste your own fluids, but neither of you care, lost in the bliss of each other.
>As she breaks the kiss, she looks at you with a contented smile before nuzzling into your chest with a sigh.
>"I love you, Anon."
"I love you, too, Morning."
>As you both drift off, happily in the embrace of your lover's arms, it briefly crosses your mind that you'll need to wash up and get out.
>The sight of Morning's gentle smile gives you pause.
>You can take care of it later.
>You tighten your grip on your mare and softly rub your cheek against her as sleep claims you together.

>You slowly drift back into consciousness as Morning shifts in her sleep on top of you.
>When the coldness of the water becomes apparent to your gradually waking mind, you instinctively hold her tighter, waking her up.
>"Wha...?"
>She looks down on you in sleepy confusion, before quickly kissing you.
"Come on, we should get out."
>Prompted by her lack of movement, you gently lift her off of you, and rinse the two of you off, before drying each of you while Morning refuses to let go of you.
>You carefully carry your marefriend to bed, not bothering to put on boxers, and pull the blankets over you both.
>As you embrace her, she holds you tightly while wrapping her legs around you.
>"...love you..."
>You gently kiss her and whisper back.
"I love you, Morning."
>You soon fall asleep with Morning pressed against you in your arms and your legs intertwined, contented smiles on your faces.

>You are Morning Glory, and you are slowly waking up with the vivid memory of a wonderful dream.
>It was another dream with Anon, and you were in the bath.
>The two of you confessed your love for each other.
>You both kissed and pleasured each other to a mind-numbing orgasm with your mouths.
>With a sigh, you open your eyes and turn to find Anon nude next to you.
>You freeze.
>It wasn't a dream.
>Your giddiness forces a painfully wide grin onto your face as you drew yourself closer to your friend.
>No, your lover.
>You can hardly believe what happened.
>As you inhale his scent, you can scarcely contain your joy.
>Despite all that you've been, he said he loves you.
>He's taken you in, given you a purpose, and loved you with all his heart.
>What else could you ask for?
>Tears come to your eyes as you lean in and give him a peck on the cheek, before whispering into his ear.
"I love you, Anon."
>At your words, he mumbles a little as he turns in his sleep.
>You settle back against your love's chest and sigh.
>After all he's given you, you want him to be happy more than anything else.
>But how can you make him even happier?
>You don't have much money, nor the skills to purchase or make a gift able to even scrape the surface of your gratitude and love for him.
>At most, you could devote yourself to him, to doing anything to make him happy.
>The only real skills you have are the ones you gained when you had to service stallions for a miniscule meal.
>Maybe you could fulfill all of his fantasies?
>You wouldn't mind anything he could possibly ask if he would just show you that lovely smile of his every day.
>Normally, you thought upon the kinks of stallions with trepidation, but now you felt joy and excitement at the prospect of being with your love in any way possible.
>If he wants anal, you'd gladly allow him in even in the middle of a crowded marketplace.
>Bondage? He could tie you up for hours, and you'd still be smiling at spending the time with him.
>Watersports, coprophagy, pegging, you'd do it all if he's happy to be with you.
>Part of you reels in horror at your thoughts, but if it were bad, why does the idea of being with him no matter what seem so enticing?
>You don't mind most of those kinks too badly after sleeping in gutters so long, especially if it's with him, and the fear of losing Anon because you couldn't satisfy him is more terrifying than any fetish your mind could dream up.
>You doubt you could live if this was taken from you.
>This is the first time you've had hope, or truly cared about anything in so long, that you would rather die than lose it.
>Determined to wholely repay Anon with yourself, a sly grin finds your face as you feel something poking your thigh.
>Carefully, you extract yourself from his arms, and pull the sheets back as you bring your face back to his bare crotch.
>You lean in and inhale his musk.
>It is the most wonderful thing you have smelled in your life, and you continue to breathe it in as your nethers heat up.
>You examine his body, more beautiful than anything you've ever seen, watching his manhood twitch rhythmically as you breathe heavily upon it.
>Your self-control fails as you stare at his penis, the wonderfully smooth head, the hard shaft with a tiny nub below the head, the small patch of hairs at its base exuding his glorious scent mixed with a small amount of salty sweat, and the kind and gentle human it's attached to.
>At the thought of Anon, your marehood twitches as you feel your clitoris wink from behind your lips.
>You gently reach down with your tongue and lightly drift upwards along the shaft as it twitches under you.
>The grunt Anon emits in his sleep sends shivers down your spine as your tongue drags along his frenulum.
>His breath hitches and he lets loose a low moan as you dance lightly around his glans.
>You lift your tongue as his breathing quickens, and he involuntarily tries to buck his cock into an orifice as he mutters in his sleep.
>You bring your face down between his legs, slightly spread from his shifting, and reach your tongue between his legs to push against his perineum just above his anus, and slowly drag upward toward his penis.
>Anon's low grunts send tingling feelings to your engorged lips as liquid drips down your legs while you gently massage the portion of his hard shaft beneath the skin of his taint.
>As you lick up the sweat on his scrotum, you feel his balls draw in closer to the base of his penis.
>His legs twitch gently as you pass his frenulum again on the way to his head, now dripping with precum.
>Your tongue caresses the his head in soft circles as you lick up the delicious liquid slowly flowing down his glans.
>He moans and bucks slightly as your drooling mouth engulfs the head of his lovely manhood.
>As your tongue brushes slowly around his member, his moans heighten as he starts to gently pump into your mouth.
>As you continue lapping at the precum oozing from his tip, the stream of your own secretions running down your leg soaks the bed beneath you.
>Anon's beautiful moans are almost constant, his hands gripping the bedsheets as you try to get at the source of his delicious nectar, forcing the tip of your tongue into his urethra.
>His moans reach a crescendo as his muscles tense, pushing his penis further into your mouth as you taste his hot, thick cream.
>You groan in delight as you swallow his tasty seed, before you are rapidly interrupted by Anon's legs suddenly forcing you off of him toward the edge of the bed.
>"Morning! What the fuck are you doing?"
>You look up to see Anon, red with shame and anger, pulled back away from you, still slowly spurting drop after drop of semen onto the bed below.
>You tried to repay him, but you failed.
>The only one who has ever been kind to you, and you fucked it up.
>You've never heard him yell, let alone be angry.
>Your chest physically hurts at the thought of him being mad at you.
>Now he's going to hate you and throw you out like the trash you've always been, and it'll have all been your fault.
>Everypony was right.
>You really are nothing more than a failure.
>You lower your head in shame, and back away in fear of what he might do, or worse, that he might abandon you, as you break down sobbing.

>You are Anon.
>Just moments ago, you woke up cumming in Morning's mouth.
>In shock and embarrassment, you panicked and pushed her off of you, asking what she was doing.
>The emotional high of the orgasm still working through your body intensifies your feelings.
>A sense of indignation joins your embarrassment as you feel your semen still pumping out beneath you.
>Despite the pleasure from your lover, you feel somewhat violated.
>She just started getting you off in your sleep, not bothering to ask or wake you up, like some creepy stalker.
>Your earlier thoughts about her getting attached to you too quickly drift back as you stare, blushing and feeling dirty, at Morning.
>As you calm down, and your ejaculation turns to a dribble, you notice Morning staring down at the bedsheets, shaking slightly.
>Your heart sinks, and as you crawl over to apologize for yelling, she backs away and begins to cry.
>"P-please don't hate me! I-i'll be good from now on!"
>Tears find your eyes as she doesn't seem to notice your slow approach, having lain her head down, and hiding her face behind her trembling hooves.
>"I-i'll do anything, j-just please d-don't g-get rid of m-me!"
>You snatch her up into an embrace as she weakly pushes away from you.
>"P-please d-don't..."
>You gently rub up and down her back as you softly coo into her ear.
"Shhh... I'm sorry for yelling. I'm not going to hurt you."
>She stops resisting as she cries onto your chest.
"I'm never going to get rid of you, no matter what."
>She weakly raises her head to look into your eyes with a glimmer of hope.
"I'll never hurt you, Morning, but please don't do these things when I'm not awake."
>Her eyes look away from you in shame.
"Besides, I want to be able to make you feel good, too. I'm happy to know that you're happy, so please don't feel like you need to go to such lengths for me."
>Morning looks up at you with teary eyes.
>"W-why would you w-want an ugly, w-worthless whore l-like me?"
>You pull her tightly into your embrace as you rub her back comfortingly.
"You went out of your way to get to know the crazy alien everyone else avoided and made him feel like he belonged. You know what I see when I look at you, Morning?"
>Her tear-stained face looks at you quizzically as you continue.
"I see the most beautiful being I've ever met, who has suffered more than anyone ever should, and still had the heart to welcome a weird ape thing as one of her own. I see the adorable mare who listened and fought to know the real me. I see the wonderful mare I've quickly come to love. So please don't call yourself worthless, because you mean so much to me."
>She buries her face in your shoulder as she sniffles and cries.
>You hold on to your marefriend, massaging her back and whispering softly in her ear, resolved to make her feel like she belongs, whatever it takes.

>After half an hour, Morning's crying has stopped for a few minutes when she looks up to you sniffling.
>"A-anon? Thank you."
>You merely lean down and gently kiss her nose as a small giggle escapes her.
>As her stomach suddenly rumbles, a slight blush forms on her face.
"Sounds like someone's hungry."
>A slight smile on her face, she looks up to your teasing grin, before letting out a short yelp as you lift her up and carry her out of the room.
>You gently rub her belly as her adorably reddened face looks up at you while you descend to your kitchen.
>She reluctantly lets go of you as you set her in a chair and remove two pans from your cupboards.
>In the edge of your vision, you see Morning hesitantly look to you and open her mouth.
>"C-can I he--"
>You quickly cut her off.
"Nope. I'm doing this 'cause I want to. Now just sit there while I treat you as well as you deserve to be treated."
>You interrupt her with a kiss before she can say anything.
"And don't think about disagreeing. I'm going to treat you like royalty today, whether you want me to or not."
>Her mouth closes, and she looks down with a smile and a hint of guilt.
>You'll work on that.
>You have all the time in the world to fix up your marefriend's self-esteem, since you have no plans to leave her any time soon.
>You try to think out a plan for the day, glad for your flexible work schedule, while you make french toast and scrambled eggs for yourself and Morning.
>As you cook, you try to sing whatever fragments of songs you remember from Earth, occasionally twirling or stirring with a flourish along with the songs.
>Catching Morning with a flushed face, her open mouth drooling slightly, you realize that you never put any clothes on.
>You really are absent-minded, aren't you?
>At least your dick got mostly wiped off on the sheets earlier.
>You sort of wish you didn't have to wash them so soon.
>The two of you will need to get cleaned up as well, though part of you doubts Morning particularly cares, judging how she's staring at you.
>You have to turn to hide your grin at the thought of providing a show for your mare.
>While you don't particularly mind the sexual activities -- at least, as long as you're awake during them -- after how lonely you've both been, and the forceful sex she's probably endured, you want to spend the day a bit more romantically.
>After all, she needs to understand that her company is worth more to you than anything she could do in bed, and that she doesn't have to force herself to please you.
>To this end, your goal for the day is to make her feel beautiful and loved.
>You know that it's just scratching the surface of fixing the damage of her past on the streets, but anything you could do would make it worth it.
>As you pile food onto plates, you formulate a rough plan for the day.
>First off, you'll obviously eat and clean yourselves up.
>You should probably change your sheets before you forget, too.
>Then you could take her to the local spa to help her relax and show her just how attractive she could be properly cleaned and prettied up.
>You haven't been there yourself, but you've heard good things about it that you never quite paid attention to.
>Tonight, you should try to take her out for a romantic dinner.
>Actually, you probably want to stop by Rarity's first thing this morning to see if she could make a dress for Morning.
>You know from your several clothing purchases, which were filled with her criticizing the aesthetics of your requests and current outfit, that she can easily make most clothing in at most a few hours.
>Obviously you're going to have to talk her down from the elaborate, flashy, impractical clothing she loves to design, but she's your best bet for making Morning see herself as beautiful.
>It helps that you could easily leverage Rarity's convoluted, fairy tale romance fantasies to ensure that she is "inspired" to work on it.
>You've overheard a few ponies remark on the often unwanted dates she would arrange between ponies at the slightest hint of affection.
>You can almost hear her ranting about "star-crossed lovers" and "true love" already.
>You shake your head as you set the table, and sit next to your marefriend.
"Dig in."
>She leans into you as you both start eating.
>You eat, just content to be near her, as you scratch her head.
>Soon, you feel one of her hooves on your thigh.
>You don't mind her closeness, until her hoof slowly begins to trail upwards.
>Just as her hoof reaches your crotch, you reach down and casually grab it with one hand, shifting it back to its original position before releasing it.
"Not right now, Morning. Save that for later."
>You give her a slight grin as she blushes.
>It's cute enough that you can't help but give a peck on her cheek, only increasing her adorable blush.

>When you've finished eating, you lean down and quickly kiss her lips as she reddens yet again.
>You could just watch her adorable face for hours.
"Now, go on up and start getting cleaned. I'll be up to join you in a moment."
>A goofy grin forming on her face, she turns and runs up the stairs.
>You look over at the clock as you finish rinsing the dishes, before you head upstairs.
>9:12.
>You should have enough time.
>You can probably ask Rarity for a good place to have a nice dinner.
>Otherwise, you doubt you'd have enough time to find one.
>From how Morning's been acting, you don't think she'd like it at all if you left her alone in the spa to make a reservation.
>With your plans in mind and your sheets changed again, you head into the bathroom.
>For the first time, you don't bother covering yourself as you sit next to Morning and begin washing her as she contentedly sighs.
>You carefully wash her beautiful brown mane with fruit-scented shampoo.
>Almost all of the shampoo and soap in Equestria is fruit-scented, for some reason.
>Her hind leg twitches slightly in bliss as your hands massage through her back.
>You finish cleaning her quickly this time.
>After all, you've got important plans for the day.
>Morning sighs softly in disappointment as your hands release her.
>As you wash your own hair, an odd sensation makes you look down to see Morning licking the inside of your thigh, heading for your balls.
>With a sigh, you reach down and pull her away from you, leaning down and looking straight into her eyes.
"Morning."
>You dart forward and softly kiss her.
"I love you, but there's more to this than sex. Besides, we came in here to get clean, silly."
>She looks away with a blush, before returning to you.
>"O-okay, Anon."
>As you continue cleaning yourself, Morning's hooves meet your back and return your earlier favor.
>Her gentle scratching is heavenly, and you can barely focus on washing up through her massage.
>You finish washing, barely escaping falling asleep from Morning's relaxing rubbing.
>You turn around and quickly peck her on the cheek.
"That was wonderful, Morning. You're quite talented with your hooves."
>"Th-thanks."
>You rinse and dry off, making sure to pay extra attention to Morning.
>Though you certainly have no idea how to style hair or anything, you manage to work her mane into something passably decent.
>You head into your room to get dressed, and once you've finished, Morning walks over to you and reaches up to readjust your shirt.
"Thanks."
>When she smiles shyly, you reach down and scratch behind her ears, as her eyes lose and she leans into your hand.
"Come on. I've got a big day planned."
>She looks disappointed as your hand leaves her head, but follows you, brushing against you as you head to the your first stop at the Carousel Boutique.

>As you through the town with your marefriend beside you, she asks you a question you'd expected earlier.
>"So what are we going to do today?"
>Noting the ponies going about their business around you, and not wanting to spoil the surprise too much, you ham it up.
"Today, my fine mare, shall be a day of unprecedented significance! Our first stop is abode of the local thread-weaver of this town, for she shall assist in the preparations for the day's activities."
>She looks a little disappointed, though you can't tell whether it's because you refuse to spoil the surprise, or because you've returned to your prior manner of speech.
>"What is she going to--"
>"Anon!"
>And so returns the minty unicorn of unceasing questions on humanity.
>"I couldn't find you yesterday and -- who's your friend?"
>Lyra looks up at you questioningly, gesturing to the mare hiding behind your legs.
"Mint pony, the name unto this one is Morning Glory. She is mine assistant, and other being of significance."
>After months of bugging you, this unicorn's capable of deciphering your most incomprehensible utterances, though she still takes a moment to concentrate before answering.
>"O-oh. I see."
>Her ears lower in disappointment.
>You'd feel worse about hurting her feelings, but she's still occasionally stalking you around town.
>She perks back up a bit as a thought seems to come to her.
>"Maybe we can all get lunch and talk more about humans?"
>You do feel bad about killing her excitement, but you don't have a lot of time to waste today.
"I do apologize, music pony, but this day has been meticulously scheduled and cannot be disregarded. Your question ought be prompted on the morrow past such days."
>Her ears droop as she looks down, muttering to herself.
>She turns and leaves slowly, replying in disappointment.
>"Alright. I'll ask tomorrow."
>You can almost see a cartoonish cloud hanging over her head.
>You'll have to make it up to her some time.
>Morning's probably curious about your species, too, come to think of it.
>You lean down and whisper a question in your marefriend's ear.
"Hey, Morning. D'you want to learn about humans when Lyra comes asking more questions?"
>She seems a bit conflicted until you amend your question.
"She's just curious about an otherworldly species. Don't worry, she could never compete with you, love."
>Morning blushes a little and stutters out an answer.
>"I-i'd love to learn more about you."
"We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other better. For today, though, we've got more important things to do than go over my planet's history. I can guarantee that you'll enjoy what we'll be doing."
>Her blush deepens when you playfully nip at the ear you've been whispering in.
"Now come on. We don't want to be late."
>As you walk on, Morning keeps pressed against you, red and daydreaming with a goofy smile.
